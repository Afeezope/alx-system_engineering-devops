Recent research on flywheel rotors has focused on high-speed composite rotors asthe storage element of the flywheel energy storage system (FESS).
Literature research indicates that this is primarily due to the high specific energy of composites compares to metals.
The study indicates that for applications where the energy-per-cost is to be maximized, metals are superior to composite rotor materials. On a total energy basis, metals and composites are on par with each other. Composite rotors are however, superior for applications requiring high specific energy. A hybrid rotor, with a metallic energy storage element and a thin composite burst-rim, is also optimally designed and found to be a viable solution, because it offers the cost benefits of metals, as well as the burst-safety provided by composites.
