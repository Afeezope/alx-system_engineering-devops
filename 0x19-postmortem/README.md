The incident originated at 9:45 am (GMT + 1) when server upgrades were initiated without prior deployment to test environments and comprehensive unit testing. One component of the upgrade required authentication from a third-party software, and this new implementation was incompatible with the current server version, resulting in the widespread downtime experienced by our clients. The swift resolution involved rolling back to the previous server state and subsequently upgrading to a compatible version. 


Preventive Measures
To prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following preventive measures:
1. Testing Procedures: All intended changes will be deployed to our test environments before being shipped to live servers. Rigorous testing, including unit and integration testing, will be conducted to ensure compatibility and stability.
2. Performance Metrics Threshold: We will increase the performance metrics threshold to provide early warnings and alerts for on-call engineers in the event of potential server crashes. This proactive approach aims to address issues before they escalate into full-blown outages.


Conclusion
We deeply regret the inconvenience caused by the server outage and appreciate the understanding of our clients during this challenging time. The incident has highlighted the critical importance of rigorous testing and proactive monitoring in maintaining the stability and reliability of our services. The outlined preventive measures are integral to our commitment to delivering uninterrupted and high-quality services to our valued clients. 
We remain dedicated to continuous improvement and assure our clients that we are taking all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. Your trust is paramount to us, and we are committed to upholding the highest standards of service excellence.
